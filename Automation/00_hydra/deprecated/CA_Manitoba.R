## Since week 11, year 2022 (2022-03-13), Manitoba published the weekly cases by age group and sex

## the below code is to automate the process and keep us updated. 

## However: we may need to get the historical data (manually) or from elsewhere if someone has collected it.


#====================

## Create a dataframe with the dates, extract epi-week and epi-year

dates <- data.frame(date = seq(from = ymd('2022-03-13'), to = ymd(today() - 11), by='days')) %>% 
  mutate(week = epiweek(date),
         year = epiyear(date)) %>% 
  group_by(year, week) %>% 
  filter(date == max(date)) 


## Loop over this dataframe to get the CASES data

IN <- dates %>% 
  {map2_df(.$year, .$week, ~ read.csv(paste0("https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/surveillance/covid-19/", 
                                             .x, "/week_", .y, "/downloads/age_sex_distribution_week_", .y, ".csv")) %>% 
             mutate(year = .x,
                    week = .y))} %>%
